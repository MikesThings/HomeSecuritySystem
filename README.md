# Motion Detection Project
This project features a home safety device built with an ESP32 microcontroller kit, a PIR (Passive Infrared) motion sensor, a NeoPixel LED strip, and a buzzer. Designed to enhance home security, the device detects motion and triggers visual and audible alerts to notify users of potential intrusions.

The PIR sensor monitors the environment for motion, and when motion is detected, the system activates a colorful light pattern on the NeoPixel LED strip and sounds the buzzer. A physical button provides manual control to arm or disarm the system, offering flexibility in its usage. The combination of visual and audible notifications ensures that the device effectively alerts the homeowner, providing a reliable solution for improved safety.

# Key functionalities include:

- Motion Detection: The PIR sensor continuously monitors the area for motion and triggers alerts upon detection.
- Visual Alerts: The NeoPixel LED strip lights up in alternating red and blue patterns when motion is detected.
- Audible Alerts: A buzzer emits quick pulses for added warning during motion detection.
- Manual Control: A button allows the user to easily toggle the system between active and inactive states.
